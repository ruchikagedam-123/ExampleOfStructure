Que. 1 Write a function to concatenate two linked lists. Given lists l1 = (2, 3, 1) and l2 = (4, 5), after return from concatenate(l1,l2) the list l1 should be changed to be l1 = (2, 3, 1, 4, 5). Your function should not change l2 and should not directly link nodes from l1 to l2 (i.e. the nodes inserted into l1 should be copies of the nodes from l2.)



Que. 2  Write a function to insert a number into a sorted linked list. Assume the list is sorted from smallest to largest value. After insertion, the list should still be sorted. Given the list l1 = (3, 17, 18, 27) and the value 20, on return l1 be the list (3, 17, 18, 20, 27).


Que. 3 Write a function to return the median value in a sorted linked list. If the length i of the list is odd, then the median is the ceiling(i/2) member. For example, given the list (1, 2, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11) as input, your function should return the value 5. If the length of the list is even, then the median is the mean of the i/2 and (i/2)+1 members. Thus, the median of the sorted list (2, 4, 8, 9) is (4+8)/2. Finally, define the median of an empty list to be 0.


Que. 4 Reverse A linked list.
